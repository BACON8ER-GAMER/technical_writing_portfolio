    <h4>Splatoon 3 Video Project</h4>

    <p>
        As part of our first portfolio project, I created a video project that is meant 
        for newcomers to use in order to learn the basics of the game Splatoon 3.
        The script, video footage, voiceover and editing were all done by me.

    <h4>AI Assisted Coding Guide for Secondary Students</h4>

    <p>
        This project was a collaborative effort with my classmates. Our goal was to help
        educate secondary students on how to properly use AI tools to assist them
        in their coding projects. The project was created using GitHub, Markdown,
        and HTML. The project is hosted directly on GitHub pages.

    <h4>Git Workflow Tutorial for Technical Writers</h4>

    <p>
        This project was a collaborative effort with my classmates. Our goal was to 
        help explain the Git and GitHub workflow in an easy to understand way for
        technical writers who are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub. For this project,
        I converted the original file from AsciiDoc format to HTML and CSS to created
        a website that is easy and intuitive to use. This project is hosted directly
        on GitHub pages as well.

    <h4>Tool Chooser for Technical Writers</h4>

    <p>
        This project was a collaborative effort and was the third project in the
        second course of the program. Our goal was to create a website that could
        help technical writers choose the right tool for their specific needs
        for their projects. With this project, I was the editor for the written content
        and tested the website for usability and accessibility.

    <h4>Music Production Capstone Project Paper</h4>
    <p>
        For my undergraduate capstone project, I created a website 
        through weebly that would show my skills as a music producer 
        and music arranger. The accompanying paper goes into detail 
        on the process of creating the website and the challenges 
        that I faced whilst creating it. The original paper is around 
        16 pages long, so I have only included the first two. If you 
        would like to see the full paper, please contact me through 
        the contact form on my website.
